I currently work at Google as a Machine Learning Software Engineer.

All opinions and content are my own and do not reflect my employer.

### Goal of this Blog

My main area of expertise is deep learning, particularly focused on applications and computer vision research. My goal with this blog is to explain different areas of AI research. This will help us stay update on an incredibly fast moving field. However, I am not interested in simple paper summaries. I want to dig deep into papers and understand what makes certain models or algorithms work, and think of ideas on future research.

The process of writing something also increases the understanding of the topic greatly. When I write about a research paper, I find interesting details and ideas that I would not have from simply reading it.

Although I focus on comptuer vision research, I am also interested in learning other topics such as genomics, language models, and computational neuroscience. I don't claim to be an expert in all the topics I write about. I try to thoroughly compile and explain information. My main goal is to learn, so please let me know if I am incorrect about anything.
